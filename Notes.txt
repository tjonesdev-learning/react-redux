**Common conventions:**

- Double quotes ("") for JSX properties (i.e. <label for="name"></label>)
- Single quotes ('') for non-JSX (i.e. style={{color='white'}})

- Use "className" instead of "class" in JSX to avoid collisions over Javascript "class"

- Use "htmlFor" instead of "for" in JSX to differentiate from Javascript for loops

- Do not place function calls that only need to be retrieved once in the "render()" portion of a class-based component. Instead, place it in the constructor function where state is initialize. This prevents it from constantly being re-fetched every time the app is rendered or re-rendered.
